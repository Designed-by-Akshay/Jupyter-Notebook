The Jupyter notebooks automatically get installed with the Anaconda distribution. You'll be able to use notebooks from the default environment.

If you are using Miniconda, there are multiple ways you can install the Jupyter notebook. You can install Jupyter notebooks in a conda environment using the
following commands in your Terminal/Anaconda Prompt:

# First, verify if you have Python and conda installed
# If the command below shows an error, try installing it first using `conda install python=3`
python --version
conda --version

# Use either of the commands below to install notebook
conda install jupyter notebook
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
If you are using pip, you can install Jupyter notebook with:


# First, verify if you have pip installed. In recent versions of Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4, pip comes preinstalled. 
# If the `pip` command below shows an error, try installing pip from https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ 
python --version
pip --version


# Use either of the commands below to install notebook
pip install notebook
pip install jupyter notebook

To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) / Anaconda Prompt (Windows):

jupyter notebook
