Notebooks are a form of literate programming proposed by Donald Knuth in 1984. With literate programming, the documentation is written as a narrative
alongside the code instead of sitting off by its own. 

In Donald Knuth's words,
"
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, 
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.

How Notebooks Work
---------------------
Jupyter notebooks grew out of the IPython project started by Fernando Perez. IPython is an interactive shell, similar to the normal Python shell but 
with great features like syntax highlighting and code completion. Originally, notebooks worked by sending messages from the web app
(the notebook you see in the browser) to an IPython kernel (an IPython application running in the background). The kernel executed the code,
then sent it back to the notebook. The current architecture is similar.


From Jupyter documentation

The central point is the notebook server. You connect to the server through your browser and the notebook is rendered as a web app.
Code you write in the web app is sent through the server to the kernel. The kernel runs the code and sends it back to the server, 
then any output is rendered back in the browser. When you save the notebook, it is written to the server as a JSON file with a .ipynb file extension.

The great part of this architecture is that the kernel doesn't need to run Python.
Since the notebook and the kernel are separate, code in any language can be sent between them. For example, 
two of the earlier non-Python kernels were for the R and Julia languages. With an R kernel, 
code written in R will be sent to the R kernel where it is executed, exactly the same as Python code running on a Python kernel.
IPython notebooks were renamed because notebooks became language agnostic. The new name Jupyter comes from the combination of Julia, Python, and R.
If you're interested, here's a list of available kernels.

Another benefit is that the server can be run anywhere and accessed via the internet.
Typically you'll be running the server on your own machine where all your data and notebook files are stored. 
But, you could also set up a server on a remote machine or cloud instance like Amazon's EC2. Then, you can access the notebooks in your browser from anywhere 
in the world.
